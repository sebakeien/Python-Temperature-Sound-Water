# Python-Temperature-Sound-Water
A different way of sensing average water temperature. <br>
The temperature_sound.py module can be easily used to understand what is the temperature of the water. <br>
At the beginning, I'll programming with the mean sea level measured. <br>
The secret of this project is to think about this problem, in terms of energy, frequency and vibration. <br>
Why the human can understand if the water is cold or hot? and the next question is: can I really know the temperature of water with the sound only? <br>
